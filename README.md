# Book_Recommendation
You all must have visited GoodReads, in order to see the ratings for the books you are interested in or looking for an interested book! You might be deciding what to read next, then you’re in the right place. You will tell what titles or genres you’ve enjoyed in the past, and GoodReads give you surprisingly insightful recommendations. Now it’s your turn to develop such a recommendation system!
You have been given a GoodReads book rating dataset (link provided in the references section). Using the Spark’s MLLib module and other related libraries / modules (additional references provided at the end of this document), you are supposed to prepare a recommendation engine. 
The Collaborative filtering (CF) is a technique used by recommender systems. Usually the two common questions those will be answered by this technique are:
•	For a given user, what are the top recommended products?
•	For a given product, what are the recommended users?
